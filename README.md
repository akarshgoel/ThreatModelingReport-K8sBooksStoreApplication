A malicious user can extract additional information from DBs or can extract the user/admin information by misusing sensitive information stored in ConfigMap.|High                     |Information Disclosure           |Ensure that we must have a cloud vault integration (like hashicorp) in place and all the sensitive information should be stored in the cloud vault.  To decrease the severity level to medium, we should deploy the sensitive information as a secret rather than deploying it as a ConfigMap on K8s cluster.   But, please note that deploying the sensitive information as a secret will only ‘base64 encode’ the sensitive information/secrets on the k8s cluster, which could still be exploited.|
|2                                                                                                                                                                       |A malicious user can extract the sensitive information as the application configuration-files are running in ‘Default’ namespace.  A malicious user can assign PersistentVolumeClaim to any other deployment (running in default namespace).|Medium                   |Information Disclosure           |Ensure that ConfigMaps, Secrets, Services, Deployments and PersistentVolumeClaims are deployed in a specific namespace rather than running them in the default namespace. This ensures that only specified namespaced deployments can access the resources.   Ensure appropriate labels are assigned to each resource for restricting access to the resources, based on specific labels only.  Ensure that we have RBAC policies with appropriate Role and RoleBinding configured for the admins/users/apps accessing specified namespace.|

Remove binary executable files from the container to ensure that files cannot be re-ran, once the containers are up and running.  Ensure that while deploying service accounts for each deployment (within a specific namespace), the automount service account token is set to false. automountServiceAccountToken: false  This ensures that Kube-API calls are blocked from the container to the K8s cluster.|

Ensure that below is set for deployment files, to restrict root calls from running containers:  runAsNonRoot: true privileged: false allowPrivilegeEscalation: false readOnlyRootFilesystem: true  capabilities:  drop:  - all As we are setting the containers to runAsNonRoot: true, we must even set the security contexts for deployments as non root. For eg:   securityContext:  runAsUser: 1001  runAsGroup: 2000  fsGroup: 3000 Use Seccomp profiles- Seccomp stands for secure computing mode and has been a feature of the Linux kernel since version 2.6.12. It can be used to sandbox the privileges of a process, restricting the calls (system calls) it is able to make from userspace into the kernel.  Refer: https://v1-23.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/security/seccomp/  Use AppArmor profiles - AppArmor is a Linux kernel security module that supplements the standard Linux user and group based permissions to confine programs to a limited set of resources. AppArmor can be configured for any application to reduce its potential attack surface and provide greater in-depth defense  Refer: https://v1-23.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/security/apparmor/|

Ensure that we implement Falco as a service on the K8s cluster and configure necessary alerts for auditing of activities on K8s cluster.  Some examples of events that should trigger an alert would include: A shell is run inside a container  A container mounts a sensitive path from the host such as /proc  A sensitive file is unexpectedly read in a running container such as /etc/shadow  An outbound network connection is established   Refer Falco Project: https://falco.org/docs/|

A malicious user can extract/manipulate the hard-coded integer value of Booksl ID or other hardcoded IDs.|High                     |Information Disclosure, Tampering, Repudiation|Ensure that JWT Signing Key is not hard-coded in the code.   Instead, integrate a cloud vault solution like hashicorp and extract the signing key on the fly by making an API call to the hashicorp vault whenever needed (for signing JWT tokens). The symmetric key used here for signing the JWT tokens should be randomly generated, non-guessable and should be a minimum of 128 bit long.   Though not recommended (incase of legacy applications), to decrease the severity of vulnerability to medium, we can define a variable here and we can deploy the actual JWT signing key as a ‘secret’ in the kubernetes cluster. Ensure that the signing key is an opaque string (minimum 128 bit long) that is randomly generated and is non-guessable to the users/admin (shouldn't be like “SigningString”).  Ensure that instead of hardcoding the Book IDs (and other detials) in code, make use of variables and pass the value of variables when the containers are up & running as a ConfigMap. We can make use of ConfigMaps here. Ensure that Book IDs are randomly generated and are non-guessable to the users/admin.   Also, ensure that identification of Admin should be based on non-guessable opaque values, rather than keeping it as a simple bool value & hard-coding it in code . Make sure that the admin token should never be enabled by default. Infact, we should create an admin role and assign it to specific/required users.|

When using the JWT you should be sure that it has been issued by someone you expected to issue it.  Always check the aud claim in the token and confront it with a whitelist. The server should expect that the token has been issued for an audience, which the server is part of. It should reject any requests that contain tokens intended for different audiences. This helps to mitigate attack vectors where one resource server would obtain a genuine Access Token intended for it, and then use it to gain access to resources on a different resource server, which would not normally be available to the original server.  Next, the consumer has to check the reserved "exp" and "nbf" claims to ensure that the JWT is valid.|

The authentication logic or session logic of the app is very weak and is based on manually passing a JWT token as an authentication reference in Authorization Header (Authorization Bearer).
